******
Fractional Charge Density Functional Theory (FC-DFT) is a theory that reformulates open quantum systems in terms of the canonical ensemble. The prototype of FC-DFT is linear interpolation FC-DFT (LI-FC-DFT), which enforces the Perdew-Parr-Levy-Balduz (PPLB) condition to DFT calculations through linear interpolation and bypasses the delocalization error.
